# Introduction- Will Lazzara
Japanese nationalism stemmed from an intense policy of state Shinto that established the Emperor as a secular leader and divine authority. Like many nations, Japan had its own set of knightly values, known as the Bushido warrior code. The system dates back to feudal Japan, emphasizing duty, loyalty, and honor toward the emperor until death. After the Meiji Restoration, which re-established the Emperor's authority over the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan made a national effort to modernize to compete with Western powers and eliminate the colonial threat in East Asia. Japan’s rapid industrialization allowed for the militarization of a central army; this was not possible under the Tokugawa shogunate. The military was fiercely loyal to the Emperor and successful in its early conflicts. Impressive victories in the Sino and Russo-Japanese wars opened the Western world’s eyes to the growing threat of the Japanese forces. Japan's annexation of Korea and later Manchuria provided new militaristic opportunities by granting access to vital resources, including precious metals, coal, timber, and agricultural products, which were scarce on the islands. 

To maintain control over its newly acquired colonies, Japan perpetrated atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war in these territories, both before and during the Second World War. These horrors comprised of massacre, rape, forced labor, and human experimentation. This project discusses three atrocities committed by the Japanese during WWII; the Rape of Nanking, the experiments of Unit 731, and the Bataan Death March. These war crimes reflect a brutal strategy aimed at intimidating dissident populations, humiliating POWs, and showcasing power through cruelty, justified through duty to the emperor and the goal of liberation of Japan from Western influence.
