# Unit 731- Brandon Tice
Unit 731, known officially in Japan as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department, was a division of the Japanese Army that performed scientific experiments on unwilling human test subjects. These test subjects were most often Chinese and Manchurian civilians or Prisoners of War (POWs). The scientific experiments were performed in Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, starting in 1936 and lasting until 1945. Manchukuo was chosen as the location for these experiments as it allowed for Unit 731, led by Shirō Ishii, to avoid legal issues in mainland Japan that would prevent them from performing their experiments. Unit 731 performed a wide variety of tests on their subjects, including biological testing, pressure chamber tests, and weapons testing. This testing constitutes war crimes against civilians demonstrating Japanese power through cruelty and humiliating people that they saw as “racially inferior.”
 
## Prisoners
Those chosen to participate in experimentation by Unit 731 were often healthy individuals, as Japanese scientists wanted to have the healthiest and most able-bodied individuals as test subjects. Furthermore, the Japanese chose them due to their perceived “racial superiority” over all other Asian populations.[^1] The civilian or POW test subjects were given a healthy diet to keep them healthy enough for testing. Additionally, while most victims of Unit 731 were Chinese or Manchurian, there was a small number of Russians used in experiments.

Victims of Unit 731 were dehumanized in various ways. In their official journals, Japanese scientists would refer to their test subjects as “logs”  or “monkeys” as a way to not only cover up what was occurring at their facilities but also to dehumanize their prisoners.[^2] Japanese guards and facility workers at Unit 731’s facilities would also often rape female prisoners. This dehumanization demonstrates how Japanese war crimes during the Second World War were often done to demean victims and enforce the Japanese view of their racial supremacy. 
 
## Biological Experimentation
Most of the experiments performed by Unit 731 revolved around biological processes, including disease transmission, blood transfusions, and frostbite experiments. While some of these experiments had the potential to be scientifically valuable, most of them had no real scientific value.[^3] Victims of Unit 731 would be injected, fed laced food, or bitten by fleas infected with diseases such as Anthrax, the Bubonic Plague, and Syphilis to track the diseases’ progression into the body.[^4] Upon infection, prisoners would then be vivisected, meaning that they would be surgically operated on while still alive and often without anesthesia.[^5] The scientists at Unit 731 would also forcibly make male and female prisoners transfer various sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as Syphilis, to each other through sex to study the disease’s progression on the body and see if it could be transmitted from mother to child. Infected pregnant women would often also be vivisected to determine what effects the STD had on their body and the fetus’ body. Pregnancy testing at Unit 731 was not just limited to examining STD transmission and its effects. Female prisoners would also be raped and forcibly impregnated to examine what conditions affected fetal growth and development. Prisoners would also be forcibly dehydrated and withheld food to study how long someone could live without food or water. 

Some experiments carried out by Unit 731 did have some scientific benefit, particularly in preventing casualties during war. During a war, the battles themselves are not often the things that cause casualties, but often the conditions of the battlefield and disease cause the biggest problems. To combat this, scientists at Unit 731 would study blood loss in prisoners to see how much blood a person could lose and survive. Once a person had been drained of a significant amount of blood, the researchers would then perform a blood transfusion and inject the person with horse blood to see if it was compatible with human blood.[^6] They would also amputate the limbs of prisoners to see what limbs a person could survive without. In addition to limbs, organs or parts of organs would also be removed to examine the body’s reaction most often via vivisection, like other prisoners at Unit 731. One of the experiments performed most often at Unit 731 revolved around studying the effects of frostbite. Prisoners would have parts of their bodies purposefully frostbitten, then be smashed, reheated, or left to die.[^7] The scientists were looking for the best way to successfully reheat a limb that had been frostbitten as well as see how long someone suffering from frostbite or hypothermia would live. If a limb had been successfully reheated the Japanese researchers would then study how the gangrenous limbs affected the rest of the body.[^8] These few descriptions only scratch the surface of what biological experiments were performed on the victims of Unit 731 with many more being sadistically performed on unwilling participants.

## Weapons Testing
In addition to Biological testing, Unit 731 also performed weapons testing on their human test subjects. The Japanese at Unit 731 performed a wide variety of weapons testing on their Chinese and Manchurian victims to test the lethality and survivability of weapons. Researchers at Unit 731 would tie victims to a pole and shoot them, stab them with bayonets, or torch them with flamethrowers.[^9] Victims would then be studied to see what areas would cause the most blood loss and what areas would kill the victim the quickest. The Japanese would also test the lethality of grenades by having their test subjects stand a certain distance away from an exploding grenade and study how far they could be from the blast and survive this included studying how shrapnel damaged the human body.[^10] Unit 731 also experimented with biological weapons such as bombs containing fleas infected with the Bubonic Plague to use against the Chinese and the Americans to create man-made epidemics among their soldiers.[^11]

## Amnesty and Survivors
There is a lack of information about the scientific findings of Unit 731. While we know the experiments that were performed and their results from testimonies of the Japanese researchers and guards, information regarding their findings is kept secret by the United States government. This is due to an amnesty deal struck between Unit 731’s researchers and the United States following Japan’s surrender in 1945. In exchange for Unit 731’s research discoveries, the perpetrators of Unit 731’s various war crimes and crimes against humanity were not prosecuted during post-war trials.[^12] Additionally, none of the victims of Unit 731 survived, mostly as a result of the experiments performed on them. Unit 731’s shocking war crimes reflect Japan’s harsh strategy designed to intimidate “lesser” races, humiliate and demoralize prisoners of war, and display power through barbaric acts.

# Nanjing Massacre- Vivian Vu
As Japan began to adopt expansionist policies prior to its involvement in World War II, the state exercised a more aggressive attitude as they attempted to expand into China. On September 18, 1931, Japan had orchestrated the Mukden Incident to justify its invasion and occupation of the Northeastern colony in China, Manchuria.[^13] During this incident, Japanese soldiers had exploded a small section of the South Manchurian Railway and blamed the event on Chinese nationalists. As a result, Japan utilized the opportunity to invade the resource-rich colony of Manchuria and eventually develop the colony into the Japanese puppet state of Manchuko.[^14] Japan continued to exercise this aggressive expansionist attitude and developed increasing tensions with China to fuel their own nation and increase power. Eventually, the Japanese army would also attack a major entrance point to Beijing, China, known as the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.[^15] This event marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War between Japan and China due to the growing tensions from their resource needs and expansionist attitudes.[^16] During this war, Japan had exercised one of the most extreme war crimes known as the Nanjing Massacre, or the Rape of Nanjing. 

## Targets of Violence
The Nanjing Massacre lasted over a period of six weeks, with the Japanese army first capturing China’s capital city, Nanjing, on December 13, 1937.[^17] Japanese soldiers had overrun the city and “hunted down and killed suspected Chinese soldiers, massacred families living outside the Safety Zone, and raped tens of thousands of women”.[^18] This event marked a pivotal moment in Japanese history and their history of war crimes. During this event, the Japanese soldiers were merciless towards the Chinese people living in Nanjing and bore a great lack of discipline. Seeking revenge for their fellow soldiers that were lost, the Japanese massacred entire families “and even the elderly and infants were targeted for execution, while tens of thousands of women were raped…the Japanese looted and burned at least one-third of Nanjing’s buildings”.[^19] 

Hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed along with the Japanese soldiers destroying much of the infrastructure in Nanjing. Despite the massacre lasting for about six weeks, the relentless torture inflicted has greatly impacted the people of Nanjing and their homes. Many felt hopeless during this time as they saw their family members and friends killed, houses and businesses destroyed, and dignity stripped. There was one German man who is best known for his efforts in stopping these war crimes and aiding the Chinese civilians. John Rabe was a German businessman and Nazi Party member who had aided civilians during this atrocity while also documenting the experience in his diary.

## Account of John Rabe
In "The Good Man on Nanking", John Rabe documented his experience during the Nanjing Massacre and highlighted the horrors of the Japanese soldiers. He writes: “It is not until we tour the city that we learn the extent of the destruction. We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind”.[^20] This account was written on December 13, the day that the Japanese soldiers invaded and captured the city. Upon occupying Nanjing, the Japanese soldiers were quick to perform their killing contests and harm hundreds of civilians. Not only did Rabe’s accounts highlight the innocent lives lost, but he also writes about the physical destruction that the soldiers had done to the city. Also on December 13th, he writes, “The Japanese march through the city in groups of ten to twenty soldiers and loot the shops…They smash open windows and doors and take whatever they like”.[^21] 

As the name for this massacre is also the Rape of Nanjing, John Rabe accounts these events in his diaries and details all facets of this tragedy. On December 17th, Rabe documents, “Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling Girls College alone. You hear of nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they’re shot”.[^22] After four days of capturing the city of Nanjing, the Japanese soldiers had committed up to 1,000 cases of rape along with their killings and burning of buildings. This also reveals the brutality of these soldiers in harming those who attempt to intervene in this sexual violence. John Rabe’s diaries demonstrate the variety of harm that the Japanese soldiers had inflicted upon the city of Nanjing during this time of war.

# Bataan Death March- Arianna Dali
The Bataan Death March was a horrific war crime led by Japanese military forces in 1942 that resulted in the death of thousands of both American and Filipino soldiers—the same soldiers who just fought for three months in the Battle of Bataan despite facing harsh conditions and inadequate supplies. When U.S. Major General Edward King Jr. surrendered Bataan to the Japanese on April 9, 1942, in the largest surrender in US military history, some 76,000 soldiers were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles from the Bataan Peninsula to the San Fernando railhead.[^23] There, they were forced into overcrowded boxcars and shipped to the prisoner of war camp, Camp O’Donnell, where they faced further abuse and inhumane treatment. Along this journey, the soldiers were beaten, starved, dehydrated, shot, bayoneted, and treated generally as subhuman in horrible conditions. This horrifying piece of history truly showcases the cruel nature of Japanese warfare and reflects the brutal strategy they used to demonstrate their power over their enemies and prisoners of war.

## Surrender
At the time of surrender, about 64,000 Filipino troops and about 12,000 American troops were taken prisoner by the Japanese forces, who had little to no food, water, or medical care to provide to the soldiers. During the preceding three month long Battle of Bataan, the soldiers had already faced extremely harsh living conditions, and as they were forced further and further to the end of the Bataan peninsula, their food rations were cut in half, and then halved again in order to barely sustain them for long enough to keep the Japanese at bay for as long as possible.[^24] This deteriorated the strength and health of the soldiers, leaving them tired, weak, and starving—and therefore unable to prevent disease or fight effectively in battle. In this weakened state, the Japanese military rounded up the soldiers and made them begin the 65 mile march towards the San Fernando railhead in the sweltering heat and sun.[^25]

## The March
This 65 mile trek later became known as the Bataan Death March, and the Japanese treatment of the American and Filipino prisoners makes it very clear how this crime secured the name. Japanese soldiers were united in their complete hatred and lack of humanity for their prisoners of war, treating them extremely cruelly and without any concern for their health or wellbeing. Even the most mild of their abuses were demoralizing for prisoners, stripping them of their dignity and their humanity. POWs were sometimes made to strip off their shirts despite the scorching sun, were mocked and humiliated because of their weakness, and were prodded by weapons if they sat down.[^26] The prisoners were also searched completely, and had all of their possessions and weapons stolen from them or destroyed, leaving them completely defenseless against the abuse they received. Many prisoners were forced to carry the heavy loads of Japanese backpacks despite being extremely weak and malnourished, and if they could not keep up, they were pushed along with rifle butts or bayonets and beaten.[^27] If the men complained, this invited further abuse, as the Japanese saw it as a sign of weakness. Though these were extremely cruel abuses, it was only the beginning of what American and Filipino troops faced. 

Soldiers were brutally beaten if they could not comply with the unnecessary requests of the Japanese. For example, when asked if he had a cigarette, Lester Tenney told a Japanese soldier that he did not, where the soldier promptly “...hit [him] in the side of the face with the butt of his gun,” leaving him bleeding from his nose and a deep cut on his cheek.[^28] When his fellow prisoner was asked the same question, he offered up the cigarettes, but still was beaten “...with rifle butts and cane-length pieces of bamboo until he could not stand.”[^29] The beating of soldiers was horribly brutal, with weak and sick men being kicked with heavy boots and stabbed with bayonets when they fell down from pure exhaustion, or even shot, beaten, and killed when they found themselves too weak to get up.[^30] The weak, starving, and dehydrated soldiers were consistently denied basic needs, and were routinely shot or beheaded if they attempted to drink water from the artesian wells and cool streams where the captors intentionally led them solely to tease their insane thirst.[^31] Cruelly, Japanese soldiers gained great enjoyment from torturing their victims, laughing with their fellow captors when the prisoners suffered and died at their hands. American and Filipino soldiers endured this inhumane treatment nonstop until they reached the San Fernando railhead, where over one hundred men were crammed like sardines into each of the boxcars that would take them to their final destination.

## Camp O'Donnell
The boxcar ride to the prisoner of war camp, Camp O’Donnell, was uncomfortable and deadly, just like the rest of the Bataan Death March. Prisoners were shoved into oven-like boxcars where the temperature was likely 125 degrees, and were unable to move or even breathe because of how tightly they had been crammed inside.[^32] The first to board the boxcars were stuck in these unbearable conditions for eight hours, where many died from suffocation or heat exhaustion, others fainted, and they all stood in the feces and urine of men who had soiled themselves during the 25 mile journey from San Fernando to Capas.[^33] 

When they finally completed this overwhelming journey and the Japanese soldiers let them off of the cramped boxcars, the exhausted prisoners had just a moment of relief where they took a breath of fresh air after hours of being trapped in the heat and stench of a hundred bodies packed together. The Japanese soldiers then forced their prisoners, stiff and numb from the cramped ride, to walk seven more miles to their final destination, Camp O’Donnell, where thousands more Filipinos and Americans died from further Japanese abuse and neglect. Out of the 76,000 prisoners who were captured on Bataan, very few actually returned home to the United States after miraculously surviving the Battle of Bataan, the Death March, and Camp O’Donnell. All of these horrific events reflect the cruelty of the Japanese soldiers and their determination to assert dominance and intimidate their captives to achieve their goals through a brutal war strategy.
