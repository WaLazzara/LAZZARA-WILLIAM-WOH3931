# Conclusion- Sophia Blanco

Japanese nationalism was fueled by state Shinto and the Bushido code, emphasizing loyalty and duty to the emperor. Following the Meiji Restoration, Japan rapidly industrialized and militarized, enabling its expansionist ambitions in East Asia. Japan's initial victories in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars highlighted its growing military power, leading to the annexation of resource-rich territories like Korea and Manchuria. In these conquered regions, Japan committed numerous atrocities, including the Rape of Nanjing, the human experimentation of Unit 731, and the Bataan Death March.

Unit 731 conducted brutal medical experiments on Chinese, Manchurian, and Russian prisoners, aiming to develop biological weapons and study human tolerance to diseases, injuries, and extreme conditions. Victims were dehumanized and treated with extreme cruelty. Biological testing involved forced infections, vivisection, and experiments on frostbite and dehydration. The Nanjing Massacre saw Japanese soldiers massacre civilians, rape women, and destroy the city’s infrastructure. Documented by German businessman John Rabe, this atrocity deeply impacted the Chinese population. During the Bataan Death March, captured American and Filipino soldiers were forced on a deadly journey with severe abuse, dehydration, and starvation. Japanese soldiers viewed POWs as inferior and subjected them to inhumane conditions, resulting in thousands of deaths.
These actions reflect a brutal strategy used by Japan to intimidate and demonstrate dominance over “lesser” races and POWs, backed by the belief in Japan's racial superiority.
